# Academic Website of Frank Schneider

I am a Ph.D. student at the [Chair for the Methods of Machine Learning](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science/lehrstuehle/methods-of-machine-learning/ "Methods of Machine Learning")  (since September 2017) at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/ "University of Tübingen") as part of the [IMPRS-IS (International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems)](http://imprs.is.mpg.de "IMPRS-IS") to work on optimization methods for machine learning. My work aims at riding the field of Deep Learning of annoying hyper-parameters and thus automate the training of Deep Neural Networks.

Prior to joining the IMPRS-IS, I studied Simulation Technology (B.Sc. and M.Sc.) and Industrial and Applied Mathematics (M.Sc) at the University of Stuttgart and the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven respectively. My Master's thesis was on constructing preconditioners for Toeplitz matrices. This project was done at ASML (Eindhoven), a company developing lithography system for the semiconductor industry.
