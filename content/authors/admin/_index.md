I am a Ph.D. student at the [Methods of Machine Learning group](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/computer-science/lehrstuehle/methods-of-machine-learning/ "Methods of Machine Learning")  (since September 2017) at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/ "University of Tübingen") as part of the [IMPRS-IS (International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems)](http://imprs.is.mpg.de "IMPRS-IS") to work on optimization methods for machine learning. My work aims to improve our understanding of optimization for deep learning.

Prior to joining the IMPRS-IS, I studied Simulation Technology (B.Sc. and M.Sc.) and Industrial and Applied Mathematics (M.Sc) at the University of Stuttgart and the Technische Universiteit Eindhoven respectively. My Master's thesis was on constructing preconditioners for Toeplitz matrices. This project was done at ASML (Eindhoven), a company developing lithography system for the semiconductor industry
