- **September 2022:** Our workshop "**Has it Trained Yet? A Workshop for Algorithmic Efficiency in Practical Neural Network Training**" as been accepted at [NeurIPS 2022](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022).
  </br>*Come join us Friday, December 2, 2022 in New Orleans to talk about which methods truly speed up neural network training!*
- **September 2021:** Our paper "**Cockpit: A Practical Debugging Tool for the Training of Deep Neural Networks**" has been accepted at [NeurIPS 2021](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2021/).
  </br>*In this work, we present a new kind of debugger, specifically designed for training deep nets.*
- **May 2021:** Our work "**Descending through a Crowded Valley - Benchmarking Deep Learning Optimziers**" has been accepted at [ICML 2021](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2021).
  </br>*In it, we present an extensive comparison of fifteen popular deep learning optimizers.*
- **April, 2021:** I have been elected as a co-chair for the [MLCommons](https://mlcommons.org/en/) working group on [Algorithmic Efficiency](https://mlcommons.org/en/groups/research-algorithms/) together with [George Dahl](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gdahl/).
  </br>*The working group will develop a set of rigorous and relevant benchmarks to measure training speedups to neural network training due to algorithmic improvements, focusing on new training algorithms and models.*
- **Oktober 2020:** I have received a Top 10% Reviewer award for NeurIPS 2020.
- **September 2020:** I have been distinguished as a Top Reviewer for ICML 2020.
- **September 2019:** I presented our work on "DeepOBS" during an invited talk at the [Machine Learning Lab](http://aad.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/hutter/) at the University of Freiburg.
- **May 2019:** Our paper "**DeepOBS: A Deep Learning Optimizer Benchmark Suite**" has been accepted at [ICLR 2019](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2019).
  </br>*In the paper, we present a benchmark suite for deep learning optimization methods. I will be at the conference from 06th through 09th May in New Orleans, USA.*
- **September 2018:** I attended the [Gaussian Process Summer School 2018](http://gpss.cc/gpss18/ "GPSS18") in Sheffield.
- **July 2018:** I attended the [Microsoft Research AI Summer School 2018](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/event/ai-summer-school-2018/ "Microsoft Research AI Summer School") in Cambridge.
